## 📖 The Story Behind This Madness

Once upon a time, in a galaxy not so far away, I bought a domain called `whoneedsthis.lol` because... well, who needs this? 🤷‍♂️

Fast forward one year, I'm cleaning up my digital closet (because even developers have hoarding problems) and I rediscovered this gem of a domain. Instead of letting it collect digital dust, I thought:

> "What if I create something that's actually useful but doesn't take itself too seriously? Like a privacy tool that's more fun than a barrel of cookies!"

And thus, the Cookie Monster Privacy Scanner was born! This project combines my love for:

- Privacy advocacy 🛡️
- Developer education 📚
- Terrible cookie puns 🍪
- Blue furry monsters 👾

## 🎯 What This Does

Cookie Monster Privacy Scanner is like having a digital nutrition label for your browser's cookies! It tells you:

- **How many cookies** are munching on your data
- **Which ones are trackers** trying to follow you around the internet
- **Security vulnerabilities** that could leave your digital cookies jar open
- **Fingerprinting risks** because nobody likes being digitally stalked
- **Practical recommendations** to improve your privacy

All served with a side of humor and zero actual cookies were harmed in the making!
